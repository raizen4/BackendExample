# Fullstack example
This repo shows an example of a .net core API using Swagger, CosmosDb and Azure Active Directory B2C. This has been the main backend API I have been assigned to develop and maintain at LaunchB.

The frontend work, listing-ui-web has been the main micro-frontend project I have developed and maintained. It is part of a wider system developed in a monorepo using multiple micro-frontends meant to replace RightMove and Zoopla. Technologies include React with webpack, typescript, jest and formik for form management. State is done using zustand (https://github.com/react-spring/zustand) whilst the overall componenets architecture follows ATOMIC principle.  On top of this, the shared components used in this project have been added in a Storybook.

I have been working on internal tools to facilitate the activity of my employers. This includes "Survey Hub" from Corelogic (https://www.corelogic.uk/products/survey-hub/) and Boomin from LaunchB( https://www.launchb.co.uk/). Unfortunately, I cannot show you the product from LaunchB as I am still under an NDA with them (but I can use the code I have developed to showcase my knowledge. This is why I have been able to provide you with a slice of front-end developed exclusively by me).
