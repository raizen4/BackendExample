# BackendExample
This repo shows an example of a .net core API using Swagger, CosmosDb and Azure Active Directory B2C

This has been the main backend API I have been assigned to develop and maintain at LaunchB.

The frontend work, listing-ui-web has been the main micro-frontend project I have developed and maintained. It is part of a wider system developed in a monorepo using multiple micro-frontends meant to replace RightMove and Zoopla. Technologies include React with webpack, typescript, jest and formik for form management. State is done using zustand (https://github.com/react-spring/zustand).  On top of this, the shared components used in this project have been added in a Storybook.
